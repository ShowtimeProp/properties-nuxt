# Task ID: 18
# Title: Implement ID Upload and OCR Verification
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 16, 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Add a component to the profile page that allows users to upload ID documents, with backend OCR processing to extract and pre-fill user information.
# Details:
1. Frontend Implementation:
   - Create a file upload component on the `/profile` page using React
   - Implement drag-and-drop functionality with preview
   - Add progress indicator for upload status
   - Design UI for displaying extracted information with option to confirm/edit
   - Implement form field auto-population with extracted data

2. Backend Implementation:
   - Create a new FastAPI endpoint `/api/profile/upload-id` that accepts multipart/form-data
   - Implement secure file validation (file type, size limits, malware scanning)
   - Integrate pytesseract OCR library (v0.3.8+) for text extraction
   - Develop text parsing algorithms to identify and extract:
     - Full name
     - ID number
     - Date of birth
     - Address information
   - Implement error handling for poor quality images or unreadable text

3. Storage Implementation:
   - Configure Supabase Storage bucket with appropriate security policies
   - Implement server-side encryption for ID document storage
   - Create database schema to store references to uploaded documents
   - Set up automatic file expiration/deletion policies for compliance

4. Security Considerations:
   - Implement strict CORS policies for the upload endpoint
   - Add rate limiting to prevent abuse
   - Ensure all ID data is transmitted over HTTPS
   - Apply proper Row Level Security (RLS) in Supabase
   - Log all access to ID documents for audit purposes

5. User Experience:
   - Add clear instructions for acceptable ID types and image quality
   - Implement helpful error messages for failed uploads or OCR issues
   - Create confirmation step before saving extracted information

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test file upload component with various file types and sizes
   - Test OCR extraction functions with sample ID images
   - Verify proper error handling for invalid uploads
   - Test data parsing algorithms with different ID formats

2. Integration Testing:
   - Verify end-to-end flow from upload to data extraction to form population
   - Test storage and retrieval of ID documents from Supabase
   - Verify proper database updates when ID information is confirmed
   - Test security policies and access controls

3. Security Testing:
   - Perform penetration testing on file upload functionality
   - Verify that uploaded files are properly sanitized
   - Test for common upload vulnerabilities (XSS, CSRF)
   - Verify encryption of stored ID documents
   - Test access controls to ensure only authorized users can view their own documents

4. Performance Testing:
   - Measure OCR processing time for various image qualities
   - Test system under load with multiple concurrent uploads
   - Verify responsive UI during upload and processing

5. User Acceptance Testing:
   - Test with real ID documents from different countries
   - Verify accuracy of OCR extraction with diverse samples
   - Gather feedback on usability of the upload interface
