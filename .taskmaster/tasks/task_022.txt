# Task ID: 22
# Title: Fix Favorites Synchronization After Pinia Persistence Plugin Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 21
# Priority: medium
# Description: Debug and fix the favorites feature reactivity issues that emerged after integrating pinia-plugin-persistedstate, ensuring proper state management across components.
# Details:
1. Analyze the current implementation of the favorites store in `favorites.ts`:
   - Review the Pinia store structure and state definition
   - Examine how the store is registered with the persistence plugin
   - Check for any reactivity-breaking patterns in the store implementation

2. Debug the persistence plugin configuration:
   - Verify the correct import and setup of `pinia-plugin-persistedstate`
   - Check the persistence options (storage type, key naming, paths)
   - Ensure the plugin is properly registered with the Pinia instance
   - Look for potential conflicts with other plugins or middleware

3. Inspect affected components like `PropertyCard.vue`:
   - Review how components access and modify the favorites state
   - Check for direct state mutations instead of actions
   - Verify proper use of computed properties for reactive state
   - Ensure components are correctly subscribing to state changes

4. Fix the reactivity issues:
   - Update the store definition to ensure proper reactivity with the persistence plugin
   - Modify the persistence configuration if needed
   - Refactor component interactions with the store to follow best practices
   - Implement proper two-way binding between persisted state and UI

5. Implement a comprehensive solution:
   ```typescript
   // Example fix for favorites.ts
   import { defineStore } from 'pinia'
   
   export const useFavoritesStore = defineStore('favorites', {
     state: () => ({
       items: []
     }),
     actions: {
       toggleFavorite(propertyId) {
         const index = this.items.indexOf(propertyId)
         if (index === -1) {
           this.items.push(propertyId)
         } else {
           this.items.splice(index, 1)
         }
       },
       isFavorite(propertyId) {
         return this.items.includes(propertyId)
       }
     },
     persist: {
       key: 'user-favorites',
       storage: localStorage,
       paths: ['items']
     }
   })
   ```

6. Update the main Pinia setup in the Nuxt application:
   ```typescript
   // plugins/pinia-persistence.ts
   import { createPinia } from 'pinia'
   import piniaPluginPersistedstate from 'pinia-plugin-persistedstate'
   
   export default defineNuxtPlugin(nuxtApp => {
     const pinia = createPinia()
     pinia.use(piniaPluginPersistedstate)
     nuxtApp.vueApp.use(pinia)
   })
   ```

7. Ensure proper hydration in SSR context:
   - Handle potential hydration mismatches between server and client
   - Implement proper initialization of persisted state during app startup

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test the favorites store in isolation:
     - Verify that adding/removing favorites works correctly
     - Ensure the persistence mechanism correctly saves and retrieves state
     - Test edge cases like adding duplicates or removing non-existent items
   - Test the store with mocked persistence plugin to verify correct interaction

2. Component Testing:
   - Test `PropertyCard.vue` and other components that use the favorites store
   - Verify that UI elements correctly reflect the favorites state
   - Ensure toggling favorites from the UI correctly updates the store
   - Test that components react properly to external state changes

3. Integration Testing:
   - Test the full favorites workflow from UI interaction to persistence and back
   - Verify that favorites persist correctly across page refreshes
   - Test synchronization across multiple components using the same store
   - Ensure proper hydration in SSR context without errors

4. Manual Testing:
   - Perform user flow testing of the favorites feature
   - Test across different browsers to ensure consistent behavior
   - Verify that favorites are correctly maintained during navigation
   - Test performance with a large number of favorites

5. Regression Testing:
   - Ensure that fixing the favorites feature doesn't break other functionality
   - Verify that other persisted stores continue to function correctly
   - Check that the application startup performance isn't negatively impacted
