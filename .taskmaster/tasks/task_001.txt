# Task ID: 1
# Title: Setup Supabase Authentication and Multi-Tenancy
# Status: done
# Dependencies: None
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user registration and login for realtors using Supabase, and create the basic schema for multi-tenancy.
# Details:
1. Initialize Supabase project
2. Set up authentication methods (email/password and Google OAuth)
3. Create tables for realtors, clients, and tenants
4. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for multi-tenancy
5. Create API endpoints for user registration and login
6. Test authentication flow and multi-tenant data isolation

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit tests for authentication functions
2. Integration tests for multi-tenant data access
3. End-to-end tests for user registration and login flows

# Subtasks:
## 1. Initialize Supabase Project and Configure Authentication Methods [done]
### Dependencies: None
### Description: Set up a new Supabase project and configure authentication methods including email/password and Google OAuth.
### Details:
Create a new Supabase project in the dashboard. Configure authentication settings to enable email/password authentication with appropriate password policies. Set up Google OAuth by registering the application in Google Cloud Console, obtaining client ID and secret, and configuring the redirect URLs in both Google and Supabase. Test both authentication methods manually to ensure they work.

## 2. Create Database Schema for Multi-Tenancy [done]
### Dependencies: 1.1
### Description: Design and implement the database schema for realtors, clients, and tenants with appropriate relationships.
### Details:
Create the following tables: 'realtors' (with fields for profile information, linked to auth.users), 'tenants' (representing different real estate companies), 'realtor_tenant_mapping' (junction table to support realtors working with multiple companies), 'clients' (with fields for client information and a tenant_id foreign key). Add appropriate indexes, constraints, and foreign key relationships. Document the schema design with an ERD.

## 3. Implement Row Level Security Policies [done]
### Dependencies: 1.2
### Description: Set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies to ensure proper data isolation between tenants.
### Details:
Enable RLS on all tables. Create policies that: 1) Allow realtors to only see data from tenants they are associated with, 2) Prevent cross-tenant data access, 3) Allow appropriate read/write permissions based on user roles. Create a 'tenant_access' helper function to simplify policy definitions. Test policies thoroughly to ensure proper isolation.

## 4. Create API Endpoints for User Management [done]
### Dependencies: 1.3
### Description: Implement server-side API endpoints for user registration, login, profile management, and tenant association.
### Details:
Create API endpoints for: 1) User registration with email verification, 2) Login with both methods, 3) Password reset, 4) User profile management, 5) Associating realtors with tenants. Use Supabase client libraries for authentication operations. Implement proper error handling and validation. Ensure all endpoints respect the multi-tenant architecture.

## 5. Implement Client-Side Authentication Flow [done]
### Dependencies: 1.4
### Description: Create the frontend components and state management for the complete authentication flow.
### Details:
Implement React components for: 1) Registration form with validation, 2) Login form supporting both authentication methods, 3) Password reset flow, 4) Profile management page. Set up authentication state management using React context or a state management library. Create protected routes that require authentication. Implement proper error handling and user feedback. Add loading states for async operations.
