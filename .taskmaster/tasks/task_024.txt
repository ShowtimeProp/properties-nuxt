# Task ID: 24
# Title: Create and Deploy FastAPI Microservice for Qdrant
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 6
# Priority: high
# Description: Develop and deploy a dedicated FastAPI microservice to handle Qdrant vector database operations, providing a scalable API layer for semantic search functionality.
# Details:
1. Set up a new FastAPI project structure for the microservice:
   - Create a new repository or directory within the monorepo
   - Set up virtual environment and dependency management
   - Configure project structure with routers, models, and services folders

2. Implement core Qdrant client integration:
   - Install required packages: `pip install fastapi uvicorn qdrant-client pydantic`
   - Create a connection service for Qdrant with proper configuration
   - Implement connection pooling and error handling
   - Set up environment variables for Qdrant connection parameters

3. Develop API endpoints for vector operations:
   - Create endpoint for vector search with filtering capabilities
   - Implement endpoint for adding/updating vectors in collections
   - Develop endpoint for deleting vectors
   - Add batch processing endpoints for efficient operations

4. Implement data models and validation:
   - Create Pydantic models for request/response validation
   - Define vector schemas and payload structures
   - Implement proper error handling and response formatting

5. Add authentication and security:
   - Implement API key or JWT validation
   - Set up rate limiting for public endpoints
   - Configure CORS policies appropriately

6. Optimize performance:
   - Implement caching for frequent queries
   - Add connection pooling for Qdrant client
   - Configure async operations for non-blocking I/O

7. Containerize the microservice:
   - Create a Dockerfile with appropriate base image
   - Configure Docker Compose for local development
   - Set up environment variable handling

8. Implement logging and monitoring:
   - Add structured logging
   - Set up health check endpoints
   - Implement basic metrics collection

9. Create documentation:
   - Set up Swagger/OpenAPI documentation
   - Document API endpoints and expected payloads
   - Add usage examples

# Test Strategy:
1. Unit Testing:
   - Test Qdrant connection service with mocked responses
   - Verify endpoint handlers with pytest
   - Test Pydantic models validation
   - Ensure proper error handling for various scenarios

2. Integration Testing:
   - Set up a test Qdrant instance (using Docker)
   - Test complete API flows from vector creation to search
   - Verify authentication and authorization mechanisms
   - Test performance with various payload sizes

3. Load Testing:
   - Use tools like Locust to simulate high traffic
   - Measure response times under different loads
   - Identify bottlenecks and optimize accordingly
   - Test concurrent connections handling

4. Deployment Testing:
   - Verify Docker container builds correctly
   - Test the service in a staging environment
   - Ensure environment variables are properly handled
   - Validate logging and monitoring functionality

5. API Contract Testing:
   - Ensure API responses match the documented schema
   - Test backward compatibility if updating existing functionality
   - Verify correct HTTP status codes for different scenarios
